inputs:
    date
    description
    amount

functions:
    "add amount"
    "delete"
    "total"

classes:
    Food
    Bills
    Fun
    Others

the app is gonna take the date, the description and the amount, it's gonna ask the "class" of that amount, and after this the amount is already 'save' on the 'data base'

Goals:
    Use module style
    learn ReactNative (not a priority)
    Make a mobile app
